# Data Storytelling

## Goal
Turn raw findings into a clear narrative decision-makers can act on.

## Narrative Structure
1. **Context**: What changed and why this matters now.
2. **Signal**: The strongest evidence (3-5 key facts).
3. **Interpretation**: What the evidence means.
4. **Decision**: What to do next, with tradeoffs.
5. **Risk**: What could invalidate the recommendation.

## Rules
- Lead with the decision, not background.
- Use plain language before technical detail.
- Separate facts from interpretation.
- Avoid cherry-picked metrics; include counter-signals.
- Quantify uncertainty (high/medium/low confidence).

## Output Pattern
- **Headline**: One-sentence takeaway.
- **Top Signals**: Bulleted facts with citations.
- **Implications**: Business/technical impact.
- **Recommendation**: Specific next step and owner.
- **Monitoring**: What to watch weekly.
