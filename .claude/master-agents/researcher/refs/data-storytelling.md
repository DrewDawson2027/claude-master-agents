# Data Storytelling

## Narrative Structure
```
Setup (context, baseline) → Conflict (problem/opportunity) → Resolution (insight + recommendation)
```

## Narrative Arc
1. **Hook**: Surprising stat or insight that grabs attention
2. **Context**: Establish baseline — what's normal, what's expected
3. **Rising action**: Build through data points that reveal the pattern
4. **Climax**: The key insight — the "aha" moment
5. **Resolution**: What this means — actionable recommendations
6. **Call to action**: Specific next steps with owners and timelines

## Three Pillars
| Pillar | Purpose | Components |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Data** | Evidence | Numbers, trends, comparisons, benchmarks |
| **Narrative** | Meaning | Context, causation, implications, "so what?" |
| **Visuals** | Clarity | Charts, highlights, annotations, callouts |

## Chart Selection
| Data Type | Best Chart | Avoid |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Trend over time | Line chart | Pie chart |
| Part of whole | Stacked bar, treemap | 3D pie |
| Comparison | Horizontal bar | Radar chart |
| Distribution | Histogram, box plot | Line chart |
| Relationship | Scatter plot | Bar chart |
| Single KPI | Big number + sparkline | Table |

## Presentation Rules
- **One insight per slide** — don't cram
- **Title = the takeaway**, not the topic ("Churn drops 40% after onboarding" not "Churn Analysis")
- **Annotate charts** — highlight the data point that matters
- **Audience-calibrate**: executives want implications, analysts want methodology
- **Start with "so what"** — lead with the recommendation, then prove it
- **Use comparison**: vs last period, vs target, vs competitor, vs industry benchmark
